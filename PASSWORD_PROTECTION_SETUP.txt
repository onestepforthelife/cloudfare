=====================================

Date: November 22, 2025

PROTECTED CONTENT:
------------------

🔒 CV PAGE (cv.html)
   Password: AmitCV2025!
   URL: https://ideas-before-time.pages.dev/cv.html
   Protection: Client-side JavaScript prompt
   Session: Stays logged in until browser closes

🔒 MARKET RESEARCH (Final_Acrylic_Market_Report.html)
   Password: AmitResearch2025!
   URL: https://ideas-before-time.pages.dev/Final_Acrylic_Market_Report.html
   Protection: Client-side JavaScript prompt
   Session: Stays logged in until browser closes

HOW IT WORKS:
-------------
1. User visits protected page
2. JavaScript prompt appears asking for password
3. If correct → Content displays, session stored
4. If incorrect → Redirected to home page
5. Session persists until browser closes

PASSWORD RECOMMENDATIONS:
-------------------------
Current passwords are strong:
✓ Mix of uppercase and lowercase
✓ Numbers included
✓ Special characters (!)
✓ Meaningful but not guessable
✓ Different for each resource

SECURITY LEVEL:
---------------
⚠️ Client-side protection (basic level)
   - Suitable for: Sharing with trusted contacts
   - Not suitable for: Highly sensitive data
   - Passwords visible in source code (by design)
   - Easy to implement and share

For higher security, consider:
- Cloudflare Access (enterprise-level)
- Server-side authentication
- OAuth integration
- Email verification gates

FILES MODIFIED:
---------------
1. Cloudfare/cv.html - Added password protection
2. Cloudfare/Final_Acrylic_Market_Report.html - Added password protection
3. Created PASSWORD_EMAIL_TEMPLATE.txt - Email template with passwords

DEPLOYMENT:
-----------
Upload these files to Cloudflare Pages:
- cv.html
- Final_Acrylic_Market_Report.html

PASSWORD STORAGE:
-----------------
📧 Email: Check PASSWORD_EMAIL_TEMPLATE.txt
📝 Document: This file (PASSWORD_PROTECTION_SETUP.txt)
💾 Backup: Save passwords in your password manager
