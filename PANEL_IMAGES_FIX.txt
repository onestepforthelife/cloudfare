PANEL IMAGES FIX - "MY JOURNEY IN FOUR PANELS"
==============================================

Date: November 22, 2025

ISSUE:
------
The "My Journey in Four Panels" section on about.html was not showing images.
Images exist in: C:\Users\araag\OneDrive\amit Pics personal\Cloudfare\images

Files confirmed:
✓ panel-1-foundation-grit.jpg
✓ panel-2-building-knowledge.jpg
✓ panel-3-innovator-outside.jpg
✓ panel-4-transformation-leader.jpg

PROBLEM:
--------
CSS background-image approach was not loading properly:
- background: url('images/panel-1-foundation-grit.jpg')
- Browser might not load CSS background images reliably
- No fallback if image fails to load

SOLUTION APPLIED:
-----------------
✅ Changed from CSS background-image to HTML <img> tags
✅ Used inline styles for better control
✅ Layered structure:
   1. <img> tag with actual image (bottom layer)
   2. Gradient overlay (middle layer)
   3. Caption text (top layer)

✅ Benefits:
   - Images will definitely load (img tags are more reliable)
   - Better browser compatibility
   - Proper alt text for accessibility
   - Fallback if image doesn't load (shows broken image icon)
   - Easier to debug

NEW STRUCTURE:
--------------
<div style="position: relative; ...">
    <img src="images/panel-X.jpg" alt="..." style="...">
    <div style="gradient overlay"></div>
    <div class="panel-caption">Caption text</div>
</div>

PANEL THEMES:
-------------
Panel 1: Foundation of Grit (Brown gradient)
- Early 2000s: LIC India + PCO business
- Financing education through hard work

Panel 2: Building Knowledge (Purple gradient)
- IIT Kanpur and professional training
- Where ideas mattered more than appearance

Panel 3: Innovator Outside (Orange/Red gradient)
- Building PartyCross.com and Daedals
- Creating connections while standing outside

Panel 4: Transformation Leader (Green gradient)
- Present day: 25%+ CAGR, ESG, Digital Transformation
- From humble beginnings to global impact

TESTING:
--------
After deployment, verify:
□ All 4 panel images are visible on about.html
□ Gradient overlays are working
□ Captions are readable
□ Images scale properly on mobile
□ No broken image icons

FILE MODIFIED:
--------------
Cloudfare/about.html - Changed panel image implementation

DEPLOYMENT:
-----------
Upload about.html to Cloudflare Pages.
Images are already in the images/ folder, no additional uploads needed.

RESULT:
-------
✅ Panel images will now display reliably
✅ Better browser compatibility
✅ Proper accessibility with alt text
✅ Visual storytelling intact
