RECOMMENDATION
--------------

FOR MAXIMUM SPO CONVERSIONS:
Use index-new.html as main homepage

IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Rename index.html → index-portfolio.html
2. Rename index-new.html → index.html
3. Add footer link: "View Innovation Portfolio" → index-portfolio.html
4. Keep all other pages unchanged

WHY THIS WORKS:
- Clear single focus = higher conversion
- ₹21 price point = low barrier to entry
- Trust signals = credibility
- Upsells = higher lifetime value
- Field targeting = relevance

EXPECTED RESULTS:
- Higher click-through rate on CTA
- More SPO purchases
- Better upsell conversion
- Clearer value proposition
- Reduced decision paralysis


HYBRID APPROACH (Alternative)
------------------------------

If you want BOTH portfolio and SPO focus:

OPTION A: Two-Step Homepage
1. Keep current index.html
2. Add prominent SPO banner at top:
   "🚀 NEW: Fix Your LinkedIn in 2 Minutes — Only ₹21 →"
3. Link to index-new.html or social-optimizer-app.html

OPTION B: Tabbed Interface
1. Homepage with two tabs:
   - "Optimize Your Profile" (SPO focus)
   - "Innovation Portfolio" (current content)
2. Default to SPO tab
3. Easy toggle between views

OPTION C: Smart Routing
1. First-time visitors → index-new.html (SPO focus)
2. Returning visitors → index.html (portfolio)
3. Use cookie to track


MY RECOMMENDATION
-----------------

Go with index-new.html as main homepage because:

1. CLEAR FOCUS
   - One primary offer = less confusion
   - Higher conversion rate
   - Easier to optimize

2. LOW PRICE POINT
   - ₹21 is impulse-buy territory
   - "Less than cup of tea" = no-brainer
   - Easy to test and iterate

3. UPSELL PATH
   - Start with ₹21
   - Upsell to ₹499, ₹999, ₹1,999
   - Higher lifetime value

4. PORTFOLIO STILL ACCESSIBLE
   - Footer link to innovation portfolio
   - About page shows full background
   - Not hidden, just not primary focus

5. EASIER TO MARKET
   - Single message: "Fix LinkedIn for ₹21"
   - Clear social media ads
   - Simple referral pitch


CONVERSION MATH
---------------

Current Homepage (estimated):
- 100 visitors
- 5% click to SPO page = 5 visitors
- 20% convert = 1 sale
- Revenue: ₹21

New Homepage (projected):
- 100 visitors
- 25% click to SPO = 25 visitors
- 20% convert = 5 sales
- Revenue: ₹105
- Plus upsells: +₹500-2000

5X IMPROVEMENT POTENTIAL


FINAL DECISION
--------------

✅ DEPLOY index-new.html as main homepage
✅ Keep portfolio accessible via footer link
