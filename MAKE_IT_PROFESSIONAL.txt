I built Social Profile Optimizer AI after helping dozens of

- How to structure the about section?
- Which keywords to use?
- What hashtags work?

After spending hours helping each person, I thought:

testing with 50+ beta users, and countless iterations.

Today, it helps professionals optimize their profiles in 
30 seconds for just ₹11.
