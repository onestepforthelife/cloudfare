If you want to protect specific pages later, you can:

1. For CV or sensitive pages:
   - Add password protection like the old system
   - Use Cloudflare Access for enterprise-level protection

2. For market research:
   - Add email gate (collect email before access)
   - Add approval workflow
   - Use "Request Access" button

3. For premium content:
   - Integrate payment gateway (Razorpay/Stripe)
   - Add subscription model
   - Use one-time payment links

CURRENT RECOMMENDATION:
-----------------------
Keep everything open! You're building your personal brand and showcasing
your innovation track record. The more accessible, the better for:
- Job opportunities
- Speaking engagements

Only protect truly sensitive information or premium paid services.
