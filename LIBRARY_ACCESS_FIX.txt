LIBRARY ACCESS FIX - PUBLIC INNOVATION SHOWCASE
===============================================

Date: November 22, 2025

ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
-----------------
The library.html page at https://ideas-before-time.pages.dev/library.html
was requiring password authentication, preventing public access to the 
9 innovations showcase.

This conflicted with the index.html messaging:
- "🎉 Free Access to Innovation Library"
- "Explore 9 innovations that predicted the future. No login required."

SOLUTION APPLIED:
-----------------

✅ REMOVED authentication requirement from library.html
   - Deleted the sessionStorage check that redirected to login
   - Innovation Library is now publicly accessible
   - No password needed to view the 9 innovations

✅ CHANGED "Logout" button to "Home" button
   - More appropriate since no login is required
   - Links back to index.html

✅ KEPT authentication for premium content
   - Market research reports still require approval
   - CV page still password protected
   - Premium tools still require login

PUBLIC ACCESS (No Login):
-------------------------
✓ Innovation Library (library.html) - 9 innovations showcase
✓ Timeline View (timeline.html)
✓ About Page (about.html)
✓ Individual innovation pages (silent-dj-2001.html, etc.)

LOGIN REQUIRED:
---------------
✓ Professional CV (cv.html) - Password required
✓ Market Research Reports - Login required
✓ LinkedIn Profile Optimizer - Login required

RESULT:
-------
✅ Anyone can now visit library.html and see all 9 innovations
✅ Consistent with "Free Access" messaging on homepage
✅ Premium content still protected
✅ Better user experience - no unnecessary login barriers

DEPLOYMENT:
-----------
Upload library.html to Cloudflare Pages to apply the fix.

The 9 innovations will be immediately accessible at:
