GOOGLE ANALYTICS IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE
=====================================

Your Google Analytics ID: G-YGVH0QGSGP

WHAT WAS DONE:
--------------
✅ Updated universal-analytics.js with your Google Analytics ID (G-YGVH0QGSGP)

Your site already has a sophisticated universal analytics system in place!
All HTML pages reference universal-analytics.js which now includes your tracking ID.

IMPLEMENTATION METHOD:
----------------------
Instead of adding the Google tag to each page individually, your site uses
a centralized JavaScript file (universal-analytics.js) that:

1. Loads the Google Analytics script dynamically
2. Initializes gtag with your measurement ID
3. Tracks page views automatically
4. Provides advanced tracking features:
   - Section detection (Portfolio, Innovation, Research, SPO)
   - Scroll depth tracking (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
   - Time on page tracking
   - External link clicks
   - Email contact clicks
   - Innovation page views
   - Research downloads
   - Login events

2. Click "Realtime" in left sidebar
3. Open your website in another tab

IMPORTANT NOTES:
----------------
- Only ONE Google tag per page (already done correctly)
- Tag loads asynchronously (won't slow down your site)
- Tracks page views, user behavior, traffic sources automatically
- GDPR compliant when used with cookie consent (you already have this)
- Works with your existing cookie-consent.js implementation

Your analytics will track:
- Page views and sessions
- User demographics and locations
- Traffic sources (direct, search, referral)
- User flow through your site
- Time spent on pages
- Bounce rates
