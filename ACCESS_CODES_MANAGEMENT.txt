==================================================
OPTION 1: APPROVAL REQUEST SYSTEM
==================================================

HOW IT WORKS:

3. They fill approval form:

   - Email
   - Company
   - Role (Recruiter, Partner, etc.)
   - Purpose of access
4. Request sent to your email: onestepforthelife@gmail.com
5. You review and approve
6. Send them access code or generated profile

APPROVAL WORKFLOW:
------------------

STEP 1: Receive Request Email
Subject: "SPO Approval Request from [Name]"
Contains:
- Requester info (name, email, company, role)
- Purpose of access
- Their LinkedIn profile data
- Timestamp

STEP 2: Review Request
Decide if you want to approve based on:
- Their role (recruiter, partner, investor, etc.)
- Purpose (hiring, partnership, media, etc.)
- Company/organization

STEP 3: Approve & Send Access
